# The-Complete-2024-Web-Development-Bootcamp
The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy is one of the best courses online that teaches Full Stack Web Development from the Beginner to the Advanced level, making students like me job ready. Here, I will be uploading the projects made by me during the course and exercises that I have solved. 

Note - This repo is only to keep track of my progress in the course and I will be uploading only the exercises solved by me from the course and some resources here. I recommend buying this course from Udemy using the link - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ for the best and complete learning experience and by any means I neither claim the ownership of any exercise or resource material in this repo nor do I promote leaking the course content on the internet for free.
